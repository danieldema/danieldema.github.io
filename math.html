                 theorems on Polish spaces can be used to prove the Erd&#337s-Sierpi&#324ski duality between measure and category. The recording is available

            <br>
            I am currently reading through <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06731"><i> Trivial Isomorphisms Between Reduced Products</i></a> by De Bondt, Farah and Vignatti. My
            current goal is to see if the methodology developed in this paper can be used to produce analogous results for other ideals on the natural numbers that are of interest.
