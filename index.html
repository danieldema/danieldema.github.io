                <p> I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto in the mathematics specialist program. I am primarily interested in set theory. Much of my free time
                    nowadays is dedicated to learning more set theory and to coding. This website is intended to be a collection of my projects, including those from the past and works in progress. Many such projects will be mathematical
                    in nature, and many non-mathematical. This website is very much a work in progress, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback! (Last updated: 11/01/2024)

                    This semester is the last semester of my undergrad. I'm currently taking courses on differential geometry, combinatorics and a seminar course on 3-manifolds.
                    (MAT363, APM461 and MAT477 at U of T). I'm also auditing a graduate course on forcing, complemented by some extracurricular readings of Jech and Kunen's books
                    on set theory.
